## Core Features:

- Code Analysis: Analyze code files in a specified directory for potential issues using a Large Language Model (LLM) tool, then output prioritized review of the discovered issues.
- Issue Reporting: Display identified issues, including severity, file name, line number, description of the issue, and the AI-generated fix suggestion.
- File Processing: Walk files in directory, then send diffs to Large Language Model (LLM)

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong blue (#3F51B5) to convey stability, logic, and professionalism.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#E8EAF6) to ensure comfortable readability in a coding context.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#9575CD) to add a touch of creativity and insight, different in brightness and saturation to create contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, to maintain a modern, machined look appropriate to the subject.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent severity levels (e.g., a triangle for warnings, a circle for errors) and file types.
- Prioritize a clean, linear layout with clear divisions between sections for easy navigation through issues and suggested fixes.
